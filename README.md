**Random Forest-Based Land Use and Land Cover Classification in Brazil's Cerrado**

This study is a final project required for the A&OS C204 course of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and evaluates the effectiveness of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for land use and land cover (LULC) classification in São Desidério, a deforestation hotspot in Brazil’s Cerrado. Using cloud-free Sentinel imagery, RF was selected for its ability to manage spectrally similar classes and resist overfitting. Third-party training data were used to classify cultivated land and natural vegetation, providing insights into the region’s ecological status. Results show that nearly two-thirds of São Desidério’s native vegetation has been compromised due to agricultural expansion. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 86%, effectively distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic classes. Incorporating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) further enhanced classification accuracy, demonstrating its critical role in the process. This project highlights the efficiency of RF for LULC classification and its potential for supporting conservation and monitoring efforts.
