**Abstract:** This project, conducted as the final requirement for the A&OS C204 course at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), evaluates the effectiveness of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for land use and land cover (LULC) classification in São Desidério, a deforestation hotspot in Brazil’s Cerrado ecoregion. Leveraging cloud-free Sentinel imagery, RF was chosen for its ability to manage spectrally similar classes and resist overfitting. Third-party training data were used to classify cultivated land and natural vegetation, providing insights into the region’s ecological status. The results revealed that nearly half of São Desidério’s native vegetation has been lost due to agricultural expansion. The classifier achieved a test accuracy of 90% and training accuracy of 100%, effectively differentiating between natural and anthropogenic land cover types. Incorporating near infrared and shortwave infrared bands significantly enhanced classification accuracy, underscoring their importance in LULC studies. This work demonstrates the reliability of RF for LULC classification, supporting conservation and monitoring efforts.
